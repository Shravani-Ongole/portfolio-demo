# 🌐 Demo Personal Portfolio Website

This is a **demo version** of my personal portfolio website, built using HTML and CSS.  
It showcases my layout, design sense, and structure — I will be adding interactivity and advanced features in the final version.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `index.html` – Main page of the portfolio
- `style.css` – All styling for the portfolio
- `images/` – Folder for used background images or icons

## 💡 What This Is
This project was created as a part of my web development learning journey. It is a static version meant for practice and presentation.  
The functional features like tab switching and form submissions will be added later.
